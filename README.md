# Aniduel

[Aniduel](https://www.aniduel.com/) lets anime fans rank their favorite characters head to head to build a live global leaderboard of the most beloved anime characters. 

# How it works

Users are given a random matchup between two anime characters and choose the character they prefer. The characters have [Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) scores which are updated based on the result of each matchup.

The character database was built from the top 1000 most favorited characters from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) using an unoffical API called [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/).
